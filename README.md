# Cryptocurrency Portfolio Monitoring Application

This is a cross-platform application (mobile, desktop, and web) developed with Flutter, created as my final thesis project at Universidade Federal de Vi√ßosa. It was designed to offer a comprehensive and free solution for monitoring and controlling cryptocurrency investments.

The project addressed a market gap for free tools by offering reliable investment logging, real-time market tracking, portfolio customization, and personalized alerts.

The application successfully provided a valuable resource for crypto investors and earned the maximum grade for its innovative approach, technical execution, and contribution to the field.
